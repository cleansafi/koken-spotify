With the URL copied, click on "Text" in the console's main navigation and create a new essay or page. Click anywhere inside the document and press return to create a new line. A space will appear asking you to click, begin typing or paste a url. Paste the HTTP link from your clipboard. A media element will appear that looks like the following:

Click the "Spotify" label and you'll see a preview of Spotify's player, which will look like this if embedding more than one track:

Or like this when embedding a single song:

If after pasting the HTTP link into essay/page you see text and not the Spotify media element shown above, first go to your Settings > Plugins area to ensure the plugin is enabled. If it is, return to the essay/page and delete the text that was inserted. Create a new line and try pasting the HTTP link again. If it still doesn't appear, contact support for assistance.
